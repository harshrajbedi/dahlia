## Case Study of STUXNET (2020)

### Background and Context

Stuxnet was discovered in June 2010 by security researchers at multiple cybersecurity firms, including Symantec and Kaspersky Lab. Its unique characteristics and the precision of its targeting quickly drew attention from experts in the field. Stuxnet was notably different from typical malware as it appeared to be specifically designed to target industrial control systems, particularly those used in nuclear facilities.
Stuxnet gained significant attention due to its complex design, advanced techniques, and its impact on critical infrastructure. It specifically targeted supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems developed by Siemens, a leading provider of industrial automation equipment. The worm exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities, which are software vulnerabilities unknown to the vendor, to gain access to the targeted systems.
One significant aspect of the context is that Stuxnet was primarily designed to disrupt Iran's nuclear program. It specifically targeted the centrifuges used for uranium enrichment in Iran's Natanz nuclear facility. Stuxnet's purpose was to sabotage the centrifuge operations by manipulating the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that controlled their speed and operation.
The development and deployment of Stuxnet required significant resources and expertise, leading to widespread speculation about its origin and involvement of state actors. While no official attribution has been made, it is widely believed that Stuxnet was a joint effort by the United States and Israel, aiming to impede Iran's nuclear ambitions.

### Attack Overview

The attack overview of Stuxnet highlights its unique characteristics, precise targeting of industrial control systems, and the utilization of multiple advanced techniques. Its ability to manipulate PLCs and sabotage centrifuge operations demonstrated a new era of cyber warfare, where computer malware was utilized to cause physical damage and disruption to critical infrastructure. 
Here are some key details of the attack:
1. **Initial Infection:** Stuxnet's initial infection vector was through the use of infected USB drives
2. **Propagation and Network Spread:** Once inside a system, Stuxnet employed multiple propagation methods to spread itself across networks.
3. **Zero-Day Exploits:** Stuxnet employed several zero-day vulnerabilities in Windows operating systems and Siemens' Step7 software, which is used to program and configure PLCs.
4. **PLC Manipulation:** Stuxnet specifically targeted Siemens' SIMATIC WinCC and PCS 7 software, which are widely used in industrial control systems.
5. **Stealth and Persistence:** Stuxnet utilized rootkit functionality to hide its presence and evade detection by security software.
