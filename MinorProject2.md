Attack Timeline:
                      
Friday, March 21 or before – Neel Mehta of Google Security discovers Heartbleed vulnerability.
Friday, March 21 10:23 – Bodo Moeller and Adam Langley of Google commit a patch for the flaw (This is according to the timestamp on the patch file Google created and later sent to OpenSSL, which OpenSSL forwarded to Red Hat and others). 
Monday, March 31  – Someone tells content distribution network CloudFlare about Heartbleed and they patch against it.  CloudFlare chief executive officer Matthew Prince would not tell Fairfax how his company found out about the flaw early. 
Tuesday, April 1 – Google Security notifies “OpenSSL team members” about the flaw it has found in OpenSSL, which later becomes known as, “Heartbleed”, Mark Cox at OpenSSL says on social network Google Plus.“OpenSSL team members” forward Google’s email to OpenSSL’s “core team members”. 
Wednesday, April 2 ~23:30  – Finish IT security testing firm Codenomicon separately discovers the same bug that Neel Mehta of Google found in OpenSSL. 
Thursday, April 3 04:30 – Codenomicon notifies the National Cyber Security Centre Finland (NCSC-FI) about its discovery of the OpenSSL bug. “Codenomicon,” tells Fairfax in a statement that they’re not willing to say whether they disclosed the bug to others. 
Friday, April 4 –  They initially say OpenSSL told them about the bug but the OpenSSL core team denies this in an email interview with Fairfax. Akamai’s chief security officer, Andy Ellis, tells Fairfax: It’s well known a number of OpenSSL community members work for companies in the tech sector that could be connected to Akamai.
   Rumours begin to swirl in the open source community about a bug existing in OpenSSL, according to one security person at a Linux distribution Fairfax spoke to. 
Saturday, April 5 – Codenomicon purchases the Heartbleed.com domain name, where it later publishes information about the security flaw. OpenSSL (not public at this point) publishes  to its Git repository.
Sunday, April 6  – The National Cyber Security Centre Finland asks the CERT Coordination Centre (CERT/CC) in America to be allocated a common vulnerabilities exposure (CVE) number “on a critical OpenSSL issue”. The centre was created in  1988 at DARPA’s direction in response to the Morris worm incident.
 Mark Cox of OpenSSL notifies Linux distribution Red Hat about the Heartbleed bug and authorises them to share vulnerability details on behalf of OpenSSL to other Linux operating system distributions. Huzaifa Sidhpurwala  adds a  bug to Red Hat’s bugzilla.
 sends an email about the bug to a private Linux distribution mailing list with no details about Heartbleed but an offer to request them privately under embargo Cox of OpenSSL.
Sunday, April 6 ~23:10 – A number of people on the private mailing list ask Sidhpurwala, who lives in India, for details about the bug. Sidhpurwala gives details of the issue, advisory, and patch to the operating system vendors that replied under embargo. Those who got a response included SuSE  Cox said Sidhpurwala was asleep during the time the other operating system vendors requested details. “Some of them mailed during my night time. I saw these emails the next day, and it was pointless to answer them at that time since the issue was already public,” Sidhpurwala says. Those who attempted to ask and were left without a response included Ubuntu (asked at 04:30), Gentoo (07:14) and Chromium (09:15), says Cox.

Monday, April 7 09:53 – A fix for the OpenSSL Heartbleed bug is committed to OpenSSL’s Git repository Confirmed by a Red Hat employee: “At this point it was private.” A new OpenSSL version is uploaded to OpenSSL’s web server with the filename “open SSL 1.0.1g.tgz” OpenSSL publishes a Heatbleed security advisory on its website.
